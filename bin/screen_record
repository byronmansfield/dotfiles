#     Screen (Desktop) Video and Audio Recording Script
#
#     Author: Byron Mansfield byron@byronmansfield.com
#
# Script for running ffmpeg to record your desktop along with audio in a
# youtube compatible format.
# Requires you have ffmpeg installed and working and trap for screen detection
# You will need to make sure that pulse or alsa is configured properly then
# adjust the $AUDIO_* values to match yours audio configuration
# You can find out more about your pusle audio settings by printing out the
# source via: `pactl list sources`
# make sure script is executable and in your $PATH
#
# Example usage: `./screen_record`
#
# Click on the screen you want to record (incase you have multiple monitors),
# give it a second to initialize, and you should be recording. Once you are done
# recording use `q` instead of `ctrl c` this will make a file called
# `screencast-XXXXX.mkv` in what ever directory you set $SCREEN_RECORDING_DIR
# to be.
#
# Enjoy
